        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>My name is Santiago and this is all brand new to me and I do not feel confident on this at all. However I think im excited to learning more.
                However my drive for school has been really low as Ive been in school for almost 8 years now because of a major change and just want to move 
                on in my life however cant do that till I get that degree so I am eager to do my best but I struggle with paying attention and staying focused.
            </p>
            <p>I have never really been confident in my computer skills but have gotten this far in my degree I am just trying to finish so I can continue working at
                my job at a store called Board Game Paradise as this has become my passion. Ive always talked with my dad when I was younger about opening up our own board game
            store but never really seemed like a possiblity. However where I currently work is planning on opening a second location with my and another coworker being the main
        managers there has really made me excited to pursue this however its been difficult to do while still in school.</p>
            <p>Now on a brigher end most recently ive been loving and fanboying over this game called Helldivers. I was in love with the first one and was eager for a new one to release
                so finally with its launch all I ever want to do now is talk about it. If you are a fan of coop craziness then id highly suggest it for its amazing gameplay and just
            absurd chaos. Its only been out for less then a week and I feel I have way to many hours already dedicated to it. But even more can never hurt.</p>
